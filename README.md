<img src="docs/primary_colors.png">
<img src="docs/secondary_colors.png">

- I have 3 primary colors used for the website.
- I have 2 secondary colors used for the website, these are used when hovering over links.
- I have also used white (#fff) as a base color under the images.

<h3>Typography</h3>
Roboto is used for the website.

<h3>Wireframes</h3>

- I used the design from the Code Institute walkthrough project, 'I think, therefore I blog', as a base for this site,
therefore, I did not create a wireframe for most of the views.
- I created this wireframe for the profile view.
